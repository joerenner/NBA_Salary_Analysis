# NBA_Salary_Analysis

This project is a walk-through of some simple data analysis on National Basketball Association statistics. 
The data is player salaries, per-game stats, and advanced metrics.
We create a linear regression model with feature as statistics and targets as salaries and use this model to find the most overpaid and underpaid NBA players.
